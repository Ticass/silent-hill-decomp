- Controls: Revamped control system so that the default camera and control style have their own, separated control scheme from the alternate control styles. Now in the launcher, under controls, you can check a checkbox to switch the control scheme you are customizing the controls for. By default, they control similarly to modern action games.
- Pulled in more fixes from sergiomanzur to syncronize cutscene voices, fix cutscene stretching, improve fog, make intro screens skippable, misc cleanup, and combat improvements (apply enemy melee damage once per swing, before you could take more damage at high fps)
- Fog level slightly increased to match real SH, but can be tuned with fogstr console command
- Fixed console ghosting and black sky when game paused in most cases
- Fixed air screamer first appearance so it actually flaps its wings
- Fixed Hyper Blaster so it can be used from cheats
- Miscellaneous qol fixes detailed below
Coming soon: Fixing the black bar on top of certain fixed camera shots, issues with puzzle overlays in some cases, leftover random crashes, issue with katana damage + continuing to work on other known issues. Please report any crashes to me and it is certainly possible I forget things so feel free to remind me (especially if it's game breaking). Want to try fully implementing PAL + other language support soon as that has been requested a lot.

## v2026.06.23.1 -- 2026-06-23
- BIG UPDATE! Sorry for the delay on this one, but wanted to get this new launcher out so that I wouldn't be so hesitant to push updates in the future. I will make a video going over this update as well, but I will list the big change below, and all the Claude commit summaries are below that.
- PGXP: Seams/Missing faces FIXED, warping almost fixed and is barely noticeable now. PGXP is near perfect!
- Collision into Invisible Walls: FIXED!! None so far after extensive testing!
- Launcher: Added build settings to choose a custom build from any point (will not overwrite the launcher). After choosing a custom build, click apply and then download build! This will be useful if I ever break things in an update and you need to revert to an old Version
- Launcher: Also added ability to use a custom repo. Meaning if anyone forks and mods my port, you can load their version directly through the launcher! They just have to post releases in their fork in a way the launcher will recognize (more on that soon)
- Launcher: Controls section, added mouse bindings and EXPERIMENTAL Thirdperson\Over the shoulder camera options! Be sure to bind the keys appropriately for these modes, and with it enabled you can press F9 or the right stick to cycle camera modes.
- Thirdperson/Over the Shoulder: Use right stick or mouse to look, left stick\WASD (optional) to move. Strafing is enabled in this mode as well.
- OTS Camera: By default press middle mouse to swap shoulders!
- TPS/OTS: You can turn on a crosshair, or invert the mouse/right stick
- Steam Deck: Merged fix from PR from sergiomanzur that may fix Steam Deck graphics. If not there is also more logging available to help. Please post in the github issue if you're still seeing issues!
- Crashing\Visual glitches: Lots should be fixed, let me know what remains! Please comment on the comprehensive issue list in GitHub
- Console: Now has history via up/down and will not glitch while the game is paused. Should be doc available for setflags console command usage for triggering cutscenes manually, if not will make it soon.

Coming soon: Inventory item backface visibility issue fix. Other visual bug and crash fixes.

- fix: Cybil approach area — restore ambient larval stalkers / grey children (free the NPC cap at the boss cutscene instead of blocking the whole map)
- fix: map4_s04 (Lisa/Dahlia) cutscene rainbow corruption — extract the 3 zero-stub draw-area/offset rects
- fix: walk-through poles / hydrants / streetlights — re-enable round-obstacle collision (console `OBST 0/1`)
- fix: preload-only phantom invisible walls — scope collision to the player's local chunk window (console `COLLSCOPE 0/1`)
- launcher: new Build Settings (pick repo / branch / build), zip-release support, and safer self-update — the launcher now only updates itself when the build is actually newer, and asks first

## v2026.06.21.2 -- 2026-06-21
- Fixed text going off screen and cutscene letterbox issues that started after the last patch, let me know if you see any issues anywhere.
- PGXP: Improved warping on edges of screen,  gone at 4:3 and barely noticeable at 16:9. Working on more tweaks and fixing the seams/invisible spots at a distance.
- Timestamped per-run logs
- Changed map console command to edit map in config and not instantly to go the map (wasn't working)
Please check the github to see all the known issues that are being worked on. Also if you experience a random crash, posting your log file somewhere like github is really helpful.                                         

Claude list:

- Crash Fixes: The Church cutscene crash and similar crash points should be fixed. Late game boat door crash *might* be fixed but needs testing. If not it will be tonight.
- Console: You can now type ., -/_, and =/+ (Shift-aware) — so commands like weld 2.5 and inveqy -50 work.
- Console: tays open after a command now (run several in a row); press Enter on an empty line, or ~, to close it.
- Controls: Esc now always works (no debug mode needed): warm-resets to the title in-game, and quits the game at the title screen.
- Controls: F1 (PGXP toggle) now always works without debug controls.
- Debug: Crashes now write a full call-stack; crash reports are self-diagnosing.

## v2026.06.18.6 -- 2026-06-18
- PGXP Improved! No more seams or messed up tree billboards. Still working on making characters look better.

## v2026.06.16.3 -- 2026-06-16

---New debug console commands

Open the console with ~ (tap to toggle, hold to type a command, debug controls must be enabled in launcher).

- give <item> — grant weapons, ammo, recovery, and story/ending items. Run help give and help give 2 for the full list. Firearms come with ammo; give allweapons grants everything. Examples: give shotgun, give flauros, give aglaophotis.
- getflags — show the event flags that determine the ending and their current state.
- setending bad | bad+ | good | good+ — set the two flags that select the SH1 ending (Cybil saved + the Kaufmann/good path) in one go. Set it before reaching the ending.
- setflag <n> 0|1 — set any event flag (0–1663) directly.
- clearflags — forget console-set flags so they stop carrying into the next New Game / map load.

Flags set via the console persist through a New Game boot, so you can choose an ending in the menu, set it, then start a New Game into the ending map to test it without a save.

- PGXP: bump PsyCross — persist shared-vertex parks, strip diagnostics
- console: expand give (story items), add getflags/setflag for ending testing
- console: add setending bad|bad+|good|good+
- console: persist console-set flags across map warp

## v2026.05.16.1 — Initial release snapshot

First public nightly. Snapshot of the PC port's state as of the launcher's
auto-update rollout.

### Boot & menus
- Konami / KCET logos, intro FMV, main menu, options screen, save/load
  screens all navigable.
- Loading screen plays correctly between map transitions.
- Pre-Konami "graphic content" warning screen wired up.
- 15-second startup delay (audio task pool drain) eliminated.

### World rendering
- Full 3D world + textured environments with fog.
- Per-vertex shader fog replacing the original PSX overlay system; fixes
  the seam line on top of the screen.
- 16:9 hor+ widescreen with per-shot pixel-aspect culling correction.

### Player
- Harry's full body renders with all 23 bones and gouraud shading.
- Movement: walk + run via collision-based path. Wall collision and
  floor height fully working in most areas.
- TPS (third-person) follow-cam toggle on numpad `2`. WIP
- Aim + fire system: handgun and knife work; muzzle flash and blood
  splat re-enabled safely.

### Combat & enemies
- Air Screamer (bird enemy): AI, animation, swoop attack, hit-take,
  death-and-fade all working. Cafe-window break cutscene plays.
- Groaner (dog): full AI from disc-extracted rodata.
- Bloodsucker, Romper, SplitHead, Creeper, HangedScratcher, LarvalStalker,
  PuppetNurse: AI re-enabled via per-enemy `*_anim_infos.c` + per-DLL
  dispatch tables extracted from disc.
- Cybil, Alessa (and her ghost-child variant), BloodyLisa, Lisa,
  Kaufmann, Dahlia: NPC AI enabled (anim infos extracted).
- Enemy spawn density restored to vanilla PSX: fixed a 16-byte
  `s_SpawnInfo` struct mismatch on x86-64 that was making every distance
  check use a bogus Z coordinate, and reduced the per-slot spawn
  cooldown from 10s to 1s.

### Audio
- SFX via PsyCross SPU → OpenAL.
- Ambient SFX VAB loads properly.
- BGM loads correctly.
- XA voice streaming from the original disc image.
- 3D audio: distance-based volume falloff restored (was previously
  full-volume regardless of distance — Air Screamer wing flap could be
  heard across the entire map).

### Cameras
- WYSIWYG `s_camCorrections[]` system with road-region matching and
  per-anchor XZ-radius override.
- Hand-tuned corrections across map0_s00 intro (3 starting-area shots,
  Cheryl-chase alley, alley2 first/second/third/fourth fixed cams,
  alley3 shots through final post-spawn), map0_s01 cafe entry, and
  map2_s00 post-cafe dog-head area.
- Rotation deltas (yaw/pitch) now stored as rotation rather than baked
  into translation — survives baseline drift on tracking cams.
- Camera correction system skipped during cutscenes (when
  `VC_USER_CAM_F` is set) so DMS-driven cinematic cams aren't perturbed.

### Cutscenes & FMVs
- DMS-driven in-game cutscenes work (opening, cafe, etc.).
- FMV playback via ported DuckStation MDEC + custom STR demuxer +
  MPEG-1 VLC decoder. XA audio mixed in.
- Enter-key input bleed from FMV skip into the next state fixed.

### Map system
- 42/42 maps compile successfully.
- PSX-address sanitizer scrubs raw `0x80XXXXXX` function pointers from
  DLL map headers.

### Debug / launcher
- Top-row `4`/`5` keys log BAD/GOOD camera positions with full delta
  capture (post-rotation translation + raw yaw/pitch nudges).
- Numpad `.` logs Harry's detailed position + camera state for tracking
  fall-through-floor spots.
- Numpad `3` rescue-teleport + collision probe.
- Launcher with display config, debug logging toggle, hi-res loose
  texture toggle, map override, fullscreen / vsync / culling / preload
  / intro / PGXP settings, dropdown for UI scaling.

### Known issues at v2026.05.16.1
- Some areas show garbage / chunky-pixel textures on walls.
- Map item screens have rendering issues (item TMD invisible during pickups).
- Falling-through-floor in certain spots (under active diagnosis).
- Handgun bullets pickup model invisible (under active diagnosis).
