# PC Port — Game-Code Fixes Index

Curated index of places where running the PSX decomp on x86-64 / PsyCross
required **patching the game code** (`src/`) or substituting a game-data symbol —
i.e. deviations from the clean byte-matching decomp. PsyCross-side fixes
(`pc_port/PsyCross/`) are tracked separately.

The goal is to keep this list **short and honest**: every entry is a spot where
the clean decomp wasn't enough. Some are faithful ports (correct and permanent);
a few are band-aids that mask a deeper cause and should be revisited — those are
marked **⚠ band-aid**. Fixes of the same root cause are grouped together.

Links point at the current `pc-port` branch; line numbers may drift, so the
function name is the stable anchor. Each entry cites the commit with the full diff.

## 1. Faults PSX hardware tolerated that x86 traps on

The PSX CPU silently tolerated two things that x86 turns into a hard exception:
(a) a NULL / small-integer pointer dereference reads valid low RAM and does
harmless garbage work — x86 access-violates; (b) MIPS integer `div`/rem by zero
returns garbage in LO/HI without trapping — x86 `idiv` raises `#DE`. Each guard
skips the work the bad value can't produce, matching the PSX "garbage but no
crash" outcome.

- **`Anim_BoneInit` — cat locker scene-end crash.** The cat scene's end cleanup
  (`func_800D87C0` → `Chara_BonesInit(0)`) passes `g_CharaModelAnimsData[1].activeAnmHdr`,
  which is NULL for that unloaded slot; reading `anmHdr->boneCount` (offset 6) AV'd.
  WinDbg-confirmed. Guard skips the bone loop after the root coord is initialised.
  The slot was NULL because of the duplicated chara-anim array (§7, `0d57ece35`);
  with that fixed the guard is a defensive no-op.

- **NPC `playbackFunc` NULL guards.** Several `*_ANIM_INFOS[status].playbackFunc`
  entries are NULL on PC (see §2); calling through them crashed Cheryl and the cat.
  ⚠ band-aid where it hides a zero-stub table — the real fix is §2.

- **MIPS argument-eval-order NULL deref** in `Collision_CharaCollisionSetup` /
  `func_8006A42C`. The merge reordered an expression whose side effect must run
  before the deref; restored MIPS left-to-right order. Caused an in-game NULL deref.
  commit [`c49602177`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/c49602177)
- **Integer divide-by-zero — chemical-on-hand cutscene crash.** The melting-smoke
  particle updater `sharedFunc_800CBB30_1_s01` does `Rng_Rand16() % temp_s1`; a
  freshly-spawned particle has ~zero velocity so `temp_s1` (its speed) is 0 → `#DE`.
  WinDbg-confirmed. Guard the `%` and the sibling growth-term `/` (its denominator
  reaches 0 as the cos input sweeps); also fixes map6_s04 (shares the file).

- **Drain-valve cutscene crash — GTE SZ saturates to 0.** `func_800CE164`
  (map1_s03 drip drawer) divides the quad size by the projected depth; a drip
  on/behind the camera plane stores SZ 0. Skip the quad that frame.

  commit [`ace3bc504`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/ace3bc504)
- **Classroom-key crash + camera-warp crash (user crash dumps).** The school
  water-drip drawer `sharedFunc_800CBDA8_1_s02` divides by emitter duration
  fields that can be 0; `vcAutoRenewalCamTgtPos` divides the warp delta by
  `g_DeltaTime`, which is 0 on pause/console/sub-hblank frames on PC.
  commit [`773bc4f29`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/773bc4f29)
- **Character fog vertex-color corruption — negative fogRamp index.** The
  per-vertex depths live in s16 slots; a GTE SZ ≥ 32768 reads back negative,
  passes the `< (1 << depthShift)` range test and indexes `fogRamp[]` out of
  bounds (PSX read harmless low RAM). This corruption is why Harry's gameplay
  render used to disable fog entirely — that bypass is now removed and all
  characters fog like the world. `PC_FOG_VTX_RAMP` reads the depth as u16;
  same clamp in `func_80055B74`.

## 2. Zero-stubbed data tables → real tables

During the port, data symbols with no decompiled definition were emitted as
`u8 X[256] = {0}` zero-stubs in [`pc_port/src/stubs/data_stubs.c`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/pc_port/src/stubs/data_stubs.c).
For animation-info tables that means every `playbackFunc` is NULL → the character's
animation never advances (crash, or a cutscene that waits forever). Fix: extract the
real table into `pc_port/src/<name>_anim_infos.c` and init it at startup
(MinGW rejects cross-module function pointers in static initialisers, so an
`*_Init()` runs from `main_pc.c`).

- **`CAT_ANIM_INFOS` — cat locker cutscene froze.** Was a zero-stub; the cat never
  animated so the scene never ended. Real table from `cat.h` (PSX `0x800DC924`).
  [`cat_anim_infos.c`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/pc_port/src/cat_anim_infos.c) ·
  commit [`f3f5d354a`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/f3f5d354a)
- **Earlier members of the same family** (already real): `DAHLIA_`, `GROANER_`,
  `CREEPER_`, `BLOODSUCKER_`, `BLOODY_LISA_`, `ALESSA_`, `KAUFMANN_`,
  `HANGED_SCRATCHER_`, `LARVAL_STALKER_`, … in `pc_port/src/*_anim_infos.c`.
  Pattern to spot the next one: an invisible / frozen / crashing NPC whose symbol
  is still a `u8[256]={0}` in `data_stubs.c`.
- **BGM layer tables — layered BGM silent on most maps.** `Bgm_Update` applies
  per-room layer-limit caps as `(vol * limit) >> 7`; the limit tables
  (`s_BgmLayerLimits`, `u8[8]`) and per-room layer-flag tables (`u16[rooms]`)
  for ~25 maps were zero-stubs, so every layer (including the always-on base
  layer 0) multiplied to 0 and the player muted itself two frames after
  `SdSeqPlay` (school: seq 786 started then `SD_Call(18)` stop). Extracted real
  tables from the PSX overlay binaries via
  [`extract_map_data.py`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/pc_port/tools/extract_map_data.py)
  (`TARGETS` + `EXTRA_SYMBOLS`; sizes tiling-verified against neighbour symbols).
  commit [`9aa8d8326`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/9aa8d8326)
- **Enemy melee collision data** — same zero-stub class, different data: each
  enemy's per-keyframe hitbox/collision rodata was `{0}`, so melee passed straight
  through them (un-hittable). Extracted into `src/maps/characters/*_rodata.inc`
  ([`stalker_rodata.inc`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/src/maps/characters/stalker_rodata.inc),
  creeper/hanged_scratcher/larval_stalker/romper/split_head/groaner). Grey-child/

## 3. IPD chunk streaming & buffer sizing

The map chunk pipeline was reworked for PC (synchronous reads, wider Hor+ view,
256 active slots). Several fixes address buffers sized for PSX assumptions.

- **Interior chunk-buffer overrun — school void / exploded geometry / thrash.**
  The widescreen residency bump (activeIpdCount→4) made `Ipd_ActiveChunksClear`
  slice the fixed `0x2C000` buffer into 45 KB slots; interior chunks (sized for the
  map's original 1–2 count → 90/180 KB) overran into the neighbour, corrupting its
  header and model data (thousands of "invalid magic" reloads). Now slices by the
  map's **original** count; residency slots get their own buffers.
  [`Ipd_ActiveChunksClear`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/src/bodyprog/gfx/bodyprog_80040B74.c#L744) ·
  commit [`cc821b60b`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/cc821b60b)
- **School black-void — stale IPD buffer drawn.** After a map round-trip a chunk's
  buffer holds another map's data (bad magic) while `isLoaded` is stale-true; the
  reformat-fail path didn't clear it, so the renderer drew garbage. Force
  `isLoaded=false` on reformat fail. ⚠ partial — see §3 overrun for the real root of
  the broader thrash.
  [`IpdHeader_FixOffsets`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/src/bodyprog/gfx/bodyprog_80040B74.c#L1942) ·
  commit [`b87e51c14`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/b87e51c14)
- **`isLoaded` byte trusted before reformat** (the IPD file's byte 1 lands on
  `isLoaded` and is unreliable on PC) — the registry-based check that replaced it.
  commit [`eb819f8b6`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/eb819f8b6)
- **`s_MapTerrain.activeChunks[256]` / `g_Map_ActiveChunksCollisionData[256]`
  overrun** — PC uses up to 256 active chunks vs PSX 4; arrays widened.

  [`fe4b6ec76`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/fe4b6ec76)

## 4. Fixed-point overflow

- **`Math_Vector2MagCalc` / `Math_Vector3MagCalc` — Cheryl fence warp.** Squaring a
  Q12 directly overflows s32 for magnitudes >~11 units, breaking distance checks (a
  merge regression broke *all* long-range checks, not just the chase). Applied the
  overflow-safe Q6-intermediate form **only at the affected Cheryl chase gates**, not
  globally (the global form rounds tiny distances to 0 and breaks collision divides).

## 5. 64-bit pointer width & struct layout

PSX `s32` fields that hold pointers truncate 64-bit addresses; merges occasionally
reverted fork pointer-width fixes back to `s32`. Symptom: faulting address like
`0xffffffff########`.

- **`s_CharaAnimData.allocAddr` — school save-load crash.** Field used as a pointer
  was `s32`; widened on PC.
  commit [`301061e86`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/301061e86)
- **Split Head boss crash — decompiled PSX stack-frame aliasing.** The matched
  idiom `ptr = &sp18[i * 16] + 32` encodes "sp38 sits 0x20 past sp18 in the PSX
  frame"; PC local layout differs, so the alias write smashed the stack and a
  garbage index AV'd (`map1_s05.dll+0x586E`, two user dumps, deterministic).
  PC path uses `&sp38[i]` directly. Swept all of `src/` for the
  `&local[idx * stride] + offset` signature — this was the only instance.

- General guidance on finding these lives in
  [`struct_offset_portability.md`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/pc_port/docs/struct_offset_portability.md).

## 6. High-FPS keyframe / frame-count timing (combat + cutscenes)

**The single most recurring root cause.** The game was authored for a fixed 30 FPS
tick; PC runs uncapped/faster. Any logic that gates on an *exact* keyframe
(`anim.keyframeIdx == N`) or counts raw frames silently breaks: at >30 FPS the
keyframe index steps past `N` without ever equalling it, so the gate never fires —
a shot never dispatches, an animation never ends, a cutscene waits forever.
**The fix is always one of:** use a range/`>=` check instead of `==`, or scale the
quantity by [`TIMESTEP_SCALE_30_FPS`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/include/bodyprog/math/math.h#L89)
/ [`TIMESTEP_30_FPS`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/include/game.h#L20).
Never re-introduce an `== exactKf` or a hardcoded frame counter. ⚠ Several of these
started life as frame-count band-aids that were later replaced by the proper
range/timestep form — watch for regressions reverting them.

- **Handgun/weapon fire never dispatches.** The aim→fire gate compared
  `keyframeIdx == aimKf`; on PC the pose blew past it. Now
  `SH_AIM_KF_REACHED(kf)` is `>=` ([`player_control.c`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/src/bodyprog/player_control.c#L3204)),
  fire allowed across the whole aim-HOLD window, and auto-aim target-switch
  transitions are FPS-proof. commits

  [`3b0eaf275`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/3b0eaf275)
- **Death / grab / get-up freeze in non-map0 maps.** A frame-count `DEATH_STALL`
  band-aid never elapsed at high FPS (and read the wrong overlay field). Replaced
  with the real `field_38` overlay-read; band-aid removed.

  [`8838b989c`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/8838b989c)
- **Cutscene timers never advance.** Events run a tick with `g_DeltaTime == 0` on
  PSX (compensated by event cadence); on PC that stalls every timer-based cutscene
  step. Feed `g_DeltaTimeRaw` during the event path instead.
  [`game_sys_states.c`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/src/bodyprog/events/game_sys_states.c#L160)
- **Melee phantom swing on release.** PSX never drains the attack shift register
  at swing end — the full hold history is what makes the tap detector reject a
  hold-release (`!(hold & 0x11)`). The PC swing-end drain zeroed it, so one refill
  tick of a continuing hold + release read as a fresh TAP → phantom slash. Now the
  register is set to 0x1F (full history) when the button is still held at swing end.

  commit [`1c5f7835e`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/1c5f7835e)
- **Cutscene desync from anim-stuck detectors (Cybil scene).**
  `Player_AnimPlaybackStateGet` (polled by map-event scripts) compared
  `kf == endKeyframeIdx` (skippable at PC delta-time — the real stuck root, now
  `>=`/`<=` range form on PC), and its stuck-bypass detectors counted FRAMES
  (90/120/240 ≈ 0.4–1 s at 240 fps) and never reset across anim changes — during
  long cutscenes they force-returned "finished" early, desyncing every later step.
  Detectors are now real-time (3 s/4 s/10 s) and reset per anim status. ⚠ detector
  (C) remains a band-aid for the still-open "nothing drives Harry into the pickup
  pose" root (KeyOfWoodman class).

## 7. Cutscene-specific regressions

Beyond timing (§6), cutscenes hit a cluster of 64-bit / merge issues:

- **Letterbox bars don't render.** The bars were built with a *positional static
  initializer* that assumed a PSX 1-word `P_TAG`; on 64-bit the tag is wider, so
  the prim was malformed. Build them at runtime (`setcode`/`setlen`/`setXY4`),
  like `screen_fade.c`. Also keep the cinematic FOV locked during the zoom-hold.

  [`4ce60bbc9`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/4ce60bbc9)
- **Harry runs/walks in place during cutscene walks.** `sharedData_800D32A0_0_s02`
  (cutscene move speed) was declared `u8`, truncating the Q12 speed to 0. Widened
  the extern + the `data_stubs.c` storage. commit
  [`bedd134b6`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/bedd134b6)

  defines several map headers rely on; restored. commit
  [`89fe373df`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/89fe373df)

  `player.c`; re-applied. commit
  [`81ab45503`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/81ab45503)
- **Lighter-hold flame detaches from the hand.** The raised-arm bone coord wasn't
  invalidated so the flame tracked a stale transform; force the arm-bone `flg`.
  commit [`393faf46d`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/393faf46d)
- **Walk/sidestep in place + no wall smack — fused speed/distance fields.** The
  fork predated upstream's rename of the player speed field: upstream uses
  `playerProps.moveSpeed` (persistent) for every speed ramp and `runDistance`
  ONLY as the continuous-run odometer that `Player_PositionUpdate` zeroes
  outside Run states (it gates the `RUN_STUMBLE_TRIGGER_DIST` wall-smack
  checks). A merge fused both under `runDistance`, so walk/backward/sidestep
  speeds wrote a per-frame-zeroed field (walk-in-place at high FPS) and the
  wall-smack thresholds read the wrong quantity. Renamed 196 sites to match
  upstream 1:1. Found while bringing up `movement_original` (the original
  PSX lower-body machine, now the default — the legacy PC movement shim
  remains for the TPS debug camera).

  [`e6aa45e0d`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/commit/e6aa45e0d)
- **Invisible school cat — duplicated chara anim array.** The Jun 2026 merge left
  the same PSX array under two names: fork `g_CharaTypeAnimInfo` (written by the
  loader) and upstream `g_CharaModelAnimsData` (read by `Chara_BonesInit`, never
  written past slot 0). The cat — the only cutscene character driven through
  `Chara_BonesInit` — got `activeAnmHdr=NULL`, the §1 `Anim_BoneInit` guard
  silently skipped bone init, and the model rendered as a degenerate point.
  Unified on the upstream name (single definition). Also fixed the
  `Anim_CharaTypeAnimInfoClear` PSX byte-count `bzero(…, 72)` that only cleared
  1.8 of 3 slots with 64-bit pointers (stale anim headers across map loads —
  prime suspect for the "warped gray polygon blob" in school hallways).

> Already covered above and also cutscene-relevant: `CAT_ANIM_INFOS` zero-stub

## Positional-SFX / world-object zero-stub batch (2026-07-06 audio audit)

Seven map-overlay symbols with real disc data were still `u8[256]={0}` exe
stubs (which shadow map-DLL data under `--export-all-symbols`). All are now
real extracted data (`extract_map_data.py` EXTRA_SYMBOLS + hand-appended to the
tracked `*_extracted_data.c`):

- `D_800ED938` (map2_s02) street SFX position — played from world origin
- `D_800D2530` (map3_s00) / `D_800D26F8` (map3_s06) door SFX positions
- `D_800D4CE4` (map3_s01) hospital generator hum position — origin was outside
  the Q12(16) falloff, so the generator loop was **silent**
- `D_800CB364` (map3_s04) stinger SFX position
- `D_800DAAD0` / `D_800DAAE4` (map5_s00) sewer pickup `s_Pose`s — pickup
  objects rendered at the world origin

Found by the new census tool `pc_port/tools/audit_map_sound_data.py` (scans all
maps for sound-adjacent `D_8*` symbols, classifies extracted / zero-stub /
missing, and diffs against the disc overlay bytes).

## HyperBlaster free-aim fix (2026-07-15, commit `7c939d88b`)

Adapted from SlickAmogus PR #36 (unmergeable — the fork branch diverged
~4700 commits from a far-back base; the three fixes were extracted and
re-applied against our current tree, keeping our newer wall-time refire FSM).
All three are real bugs in our tree, in the TPS/OTS free-aim gun path:

- **Invisible upper body while aiming**: `Pc_AimHoldKf` pinned the aim pose at
  the shared kf 591, but the HyperBlaster's WEP53 block only spans kf 568-579
  (`D_80028B94[132..149]`), so the torso posed from out-of-range keyframe data
  and collapsed. Now holds 574 (`player_control.c`).
- **Fire lockout / no full-auto**: the free-aim FSM treated it as a semi-auto
  magazine gun. Its clip count is 0 and never refills, so `fireEdge && ammo>0`
  locked firing out and the reload branch could latch. HyperBlaster is PSX
  full-auto with no ammo/reload — now fires while held once per recoil cycle
  (`isHyperBlaster ? (fireHeld && s_refireT <= 0) : (fireEdge && ammo > 0)`),
  reload skipped (`!isHyperBlaster`). Kept our wall-time `s_refireT`; did NOT
  regress to the PR's frame-based `s_refireCd`.
- **OOB anim-info copy on equip**: the equip path copies a fixed 20 entries but
  the HyperBlaster block is the last one and only 18 long, reading 2 past
  `D_80028B94`. Bounded behind `SH_PC_PORT` via a new `D_80028B94_COUNT`
  (`bodyprog_data_80028B94.c`).

## Controls / free-aim batch (2026-07-06, commit `003cd4cec` + PsyCross `90f0d9e`)

- **altcam_button_sprint** (new config, default 0): alt cameras walk by
  default, sprint only on the bound Run control (`player_control.c`, both the
  TPS/OTS/FPS path and 2D-control-under-alt-cam path). Launcher checkbox +
  sensitivity sliders second-column rework (`ControlsForm.cs`).
- **Double-fire / zoom-exit on trigger mash** (alt modes):
  `Pc_FreeAimGunUpperBody` refire cooldown wall-time 0.2s + 50ms release
  debounce (was 4 rendered frames); FSM gate + TPS zoom now also hold on the
  raw aim input so 1-frame `isAiming` blips can't drop to the PSX gun path
  (extra ungated shot) or pop the zoom.
- **Free-aim accuracy**: PSX random shot deviation capped for player shots in
  alt cameras (`bodyprog_combat_8008A058.c`; handgun/rifle ~exact, shotgun
  fixed 4° cone). Classic camera keeps the original accuracy model.
- **Firing-pose shadow glitch** (per-pixel shadows): PsyCross flashlight
  shadow FIFO entries value-validated like PGXP (`PsyX_GPU.cpp`) — CPU-built
  quads (muzzle flash) no longer inherit stale arm/gun view-space verts.
- **PGXP near-camera warp**: root-caused; fix = GL near-plane clipping
  (`PgxpNearClipEmit`), documented in `PGXP_Architecture.md` §9.

## BGM reverb + ADSR batch (2026-07-06, commit `4a37582ca` + PsyCross `12a5ab5`)

User side-by-side vs PSX: layer fade-ins/outs abrupt, echo/reverb character
missing; `adsr 1` confirmed improving fade-ins. Root causes + fixes:

- **`SpuSetReverbModeParam` was unimplemented** — but SH1 drives reverb
  through it constantly: per-track wet depth on every BGM bank load
  (`g_Sd_ReverbDepths[35]`, sd_call.c VabLoad), and a per-tick 0→target depth
  RAMP on sequence (re)start (`replay_reverb_set`, the "fades in with an
  echo"). Depth now maps to the OpenAL aux-slot gain (live). `revscale`
  console + `reverb_scale` config calibrate the mapping (default 2.0).
- **ADSR envelopes default ON** (`adsr` config key, default 1; console
  toggle). The deadlock + key-status hangs that justified default-off are
  fixed; envelopes are required for the music's instrument fades.

## FPS-camera polish + FIX_ANG framing rework (2026-07-06, commits `696fdde61`, `1cb6b4bdb` + PsyCross `8c34600`)

- **Melee-swing mesh flash in first person** (`02280a0cc`; hide attempt
  `696fdde61` REVERTED `79b685a51`): swings lean Harry's head (and the
  eye riding it) through his own torso/shoulder/arm models. Final fix is
  the arm-clearance camera dolly in `Pc_TpsCamera_Apply`: while a melee
  `weaponAttack` is active, the eye dollies back along the view axis by
  how much the nearest forearm/hand bone crowds it (proximity-driven, so
  it self-times per weapon anim; wall-clamped by ray trace). The interim
  torso/shoulder hide was reverted once the dolly landed — the body
  stays visible through swings; only the head-only FPS hide remains.
- **Faded letterbox band at top of screen** (`1cb6b4bdb` + PsyCross
  `8c34600`): the FIX_ANG `g_PsxWorldVShift` framing band-aid (843b3a58c)
  shifted the ortho window up, revealing rows above the 224-line frame
  that screen-space overlay prims never cover — a faded band toggling
  with FIX_ANG camera zones, in every camera style (an interim alt-cam
  gate `a42e02d0a` only masked it for FPS/TPS/OTS). Rework: MainLoop
  (game_main.c) applies the shift at the GTE projection center
  (`SetGeomOffset(0, vshift)`) during classic-camera gameplay only —
  same visible world window, full overlay coverage, no band. Asserted
  every frame in every state so item screens/menus keep the clean (0,0)
  baseline. `vshift` console command still live-tunes the amount.
- **Eclipse-door key-insert grey flash** (`e05613a3f`):
  `Screen_BackgroundImgTransition` (the ~1s dissolve between DOOR_*.TIM
  lock states) was the only fullscreen-2D-background draw path not
  pinging `g_Pc2dBackgroundActive`; mid-fade the 300ms `bg2dHeld` hold
  expired → fog-grey clear (dithered = black specks) leaked through the
  semi-trans fade quads and Hor+ re-engaged. Rule: EVERY fullscreen 2D
  background draw path must ping the counter.

## Interior flat-texture regression (2026-07-06, revert `cec9ef496`)

- **"Texture corruption" in interiors (school most often)** — most wall/
  door materials rendering FLAT with a few textured survivors — was the
  Jul 1 `Lm_UntextureVramCollisions` flattener (`0fa6cbb10`) over-firing:
  it untextured BOTH materials of any keep-set pair sharing a CLUT
  column, every frame (the school's SC2FT1 legitimately sits at clut
  column (0,0)). It had been shipped for the map3_s02 Alessa rainbow,
  later proven to be a cutscene P_TAG overlay bug (fix still pending).
  Reverted; the Jun 29 stolen-page untexture (`g_PcInteriorMatSync`,
  the real rainbow guard) is kept. Reported MSAA-8x correlation was a
  red herring.

## Alt-camera melee parity (2026-07-06, commit `86578da27`)

- **Multi-tap combos impossible in TPS/OTS/FPS**: the combo click queue
  counted only pad action-mask edges; alt cameras read fire via SDL
  (mouse), so it stayed empty. `g_PcAltFireHeld` publish feeds it now.
- **Every click dispatched the wide swipe** (combo window only opens
  from tap-class swings): the shim now mirrors the PSX shift-register
  semantics on a wall clock — hold >= 130ms = swipe (`IsAttacking`),
  completed shorter click = tap pulse (`IsShooting`, dispatch on
  release, like classic).
- **Katana lunge missing in alt cameras**: the aim shim forced
  `lowerBodyState = Aim` every frame, stomping the swing's `Attack`
  lower-body state that carries the attack root motion; no longer
  overwritten mid-swing (also stops movement fighting active swings).

## Custom textures: hi-res PNG/TIM overrides render for real (2026-07-08)

- The hi-res override registry (`hires_override.c`) existed but nothing
  consulted it at draw time, so registered overrides never rendered.
  PsyCross (`7ffe8b9`, port of PsyCross PR #5) now routes every textured
  prim through `HiresOverride_LookupByTpageClut` and binds the override
  via the existing `TF_32_BIT_RGBA` path, with a `u_texOffset` uniform so
  surfaces wider than one tpage sample the right region per prim.
- PNG input: `HiresOverride_RegisterFromTim` sniffs the PNG magic and
  decodes via vendored `stb_image.h` (v2.30, byte-identical to upstream,
  PNG-only/memory-only). PNG carries true 8-bit alpha: 0 = hole (shader
  discards < 0.5), ~128 = STP-style blend on semi-trans prims, 255 =
  opaque. TIMs keep 1-bit colour-0 transparency.
- Discovery (`fsqueue_3.c`): with `allow_loose_files = 1`, a loose
  `gamedata/load/<FOLDER>/<NAME>.png` (e.g. `1ST/KONAMI2.TIM.png`)
  always registers as an override (never a byte-replace) regardless of
  size; the disc file still loads so the engine picks the native VRAM
  rect, then `PostLoadTim` registers the PNG against it. Any resolution
  works — native UVs map 0..1 over the original, so uniform upscales
  (2x/4x/8x) just work.
- Salvaged by hand from unmergeable PR #38 (its branch diffs the whole
  tree as added; merging would clobber current work — reference only).
  v1 limitation: tpage/clut-keyed overrides fit single-tpage assets
  (items, HUD, sprites, character textures); packed world/interior
  atlases need the per-material residency rework.
- Loose/hires diagnostics moved from stderr to SH_DBG so they land in
  SilentHill.log. Byte-identical with `allow_loose_files = 0` (weak
  stub, zero registrations, override state stays 0).

## VRAM residency: expanded chunk-texture pool (2026-07-08)

- The 10-slot VRAM chunk-texture pool is the root of the recurring interior
  flat/rainbow class and the open exterior APU cross-area rainbow. With
  `resident_textures = 1` (default) the pool grows by 128 full + 48 half
  VIRTUAL slots (`terrain.h PC_TEXPOOL_*`): each is backed by a persistent
  per-slot GL texture instead of a VRAM page, keyed by a synthetic prim CLUT
  with bit 15 set (encoding in `hires_override.h`), delivered per prim
  through the Phase-0 override path. `PostLoadTim` skips the VRAM upload for
  virtual slots and decodes the TIM (or a loose PNG/TIM replacement — custom
  WORLD textures now work) into the slot texture.
- Interiors texture EVERY loaded chunk (whole map resident); the PC
  keep-4-nearest + page-steal loop and both `g_PcInteriorMatSync` shims are
  bypassed (kept only for `resident_textures = 0`). Exteriors keep the
  vanilla distance loop; the expanded capacity alone removes slot collisions.
- `SPUM602F` (map4_s03 Twinfeeler) is pinned to physical slots: map code
  StoreImages its CLUT row and derives palette-animation rows from its
  imageDesc, which requires a real VRAM CLUT (`Pc_MaterialNeedsVramSlot`).
- Missing-TIM materials swap back to a physical slot so the PSX degraded
  look (stale page) is preserved; `[POOLTEX]` log lines cover registration,
  loose replacement, and pool-exhaustion sizing.
- PsyCross 2nd commit: the FT4 clutY>511 garbage-prim guard exempts prims
  the override table claims (bit-15 keys); lookup fast path requires the low
  6 clut bits clear so garbage cluts still reject 63/64.
- Full design + survey findings: docs/Texture_Residency_And_Custom_Textures_Task.md §10.

## DuckStation texture-pack support (2026-07-08)

- Drop existing DuckStation texture packs into `gamedata/texturemods/` —
  loose folders (e.g. a `replacements/` dir) or whole `.zip` archives — and
  with `texture_packs = 1` (default) they apply automatically. Matching is by
  content hash exactly like DuckStation: `texupload-P4-<srcHash>-<palHash>-
  <WxH>-<ox>-<oy>-<wxh>-P<min>-<max>.png` where srcHash = XXH3-64 of the VRAM
  upload payload (our TIM pixel block) and palHash = XXH3-64 of the CLUT
  (including DuckStation's partial-range quirk: the FIRST max-min+1 entries).
  P4/P8/STP4/STP8/C16/STC16 names supported.
- At `PostLoadTim`, every TIM upload is hashed; matching sub-rect PNGs are
  composited over a nearest-upscaled base at the pack's scale (mirroring
  DuckStation's compositor), then registered as a per-slot GL texture
  (virtual pool slots = world/interior textures) or a rect-keyed override
  (VRAM TIMs: items, HUD, charas, 2D backgrounds). Loose `gamedata/load/`
  replacements keep working unchanged and take priority over packs.
- `pc_port/src/tex_pack.c`; vendored `xxhash.h` (v0.8.3, BSD) +
  `miniz` (3.0.2, MIT) for hashing and zip reading. `[TEXPACK]` log lines
  cover indexing and per-upload composition. Validated against a real 12k-
  file pack (index parity with ground truth; end-to-end compose test with
  loose + zip + partial-palette entries).
- Loose folders and `.zip` archives are both read IN PLACE (miniz) — nothing is
  extracted to disk by the GAME. `.rar` has no in-place path (solid/RAR5 make
  random access impractical) so the GAME never touches rar; instead the launcher's
  Mod Manager extracts a `.rar` to `<rar>.extracted/`, which the game then reads as
  an ordinary loose folder (see below). The standard DuckStation layout —
  `<GAMEID>/replacements/...` with a `config.yaml` — works as-is at any nesting
  depth (scan is recursive; names matched by basename). A `texturemods` entry
  (folder or `.zip`) renamed `<name>.disabled` is skipped (`Name_IsDisabled`);
  this is how the Mod Manager toggles a pack off. `texpage-*` entries
  (page-mode dumps) are unsupported and counted in the log.

## Texture-pack load order (2026-07-11)

- `gamedata/texturemods/loadorder.txt` (one top-level pack folder per line,
  HIGHEST priority first) ranks packs when two replace the SAME sub-rect of the
  same source texture. `tex_pack.c` reads it in `Scan_Once`, tags each
  `PackEntry` with a `priority` (from the file) + insertion `seq`, and the
  compositor's `qsort` is now a TOTAL order `(srcHash, priority, seq)` so the
  higher-priority pack blits LAST (wins). Absent file = every priority 0 =
  deterministic insertion order (was qsort-by-srcHash alone = undefined order
  for same-hash entries). No change when `texture_packs=0` (zero entries).
- Written by the launcher's Mod Manager (see below); different sub-rects still
  composite/augment as before — order only decides same-sub-rect conflicts.

## Bullet-decal depth split (2026-07-11)

- `pc_port/src/pc_decals.c`: decals were painting over objects standing in FRONT
  of the wall they sit on. Root: the world is painter's OT-ordered by default
  (GL depth test only under `pgxpZBuffer`), and decals are added to the world OT
  AFTER the walls, so a decal needs a NEARER bucket just to be visible over its
  host — but the single `DECAL_SZ_BIAS=96` pulled the bucket 3 buckets nearer,
  over-drawing any foreground geometry within ~3 buckets. Fix: split the one
  bias into two — `DECAL_SZ_BIAS=96` stays for the per-vertex GL depth (the
  pgxpZBuffer path still needs a full 64-SZ quantum + margin vs the wall's
  quantized depth), and `DECAL_BUCKET_BIAS=32` is the painter's OT bucket bias =
  exactly ONE bucket nearer (minimum to draw over the coplanar wall). Lever if
  decals ever vanish on steeply-angled walls: raise `DECAL_BUCKET_BIAS` toward
  48-64 (visibility-vs-overdraw tradeoff; 32 is the aggressive end).

## Launcher Mod Manager (2026-07-11)

- Replaces the launcher's Level dropdown with a `manager.png` button (Form1)
  that opens `ModManagerForm`. Two homes (both additive — nothing touches the
  disc image): TEXTURE mods in `gamedata/texturemods/`, managed IN PLACE; LOAD /
  FMV mods in a self-owned `mods/` library, deployed on Apply.
- **Texture mods** = a loose folder, a `.zip`, or a `.rar` in
  `gamedata/texturemods/`. Folder/`.zip` are read in place by the game; the
  checkbox enable/disable renames the entry to/from a trailing `.disabled`. A
  `.rar` is extracted by the launcher (see rar note) to `<rar>.extracted/`, which
  the game reads as a loose folder; enable/disable renames THAT folder
  (`<rar>.extracted` ↔ `.disabled`, kept so re-enable needn't re-extract), the rar
  file itself stays put (the game ignores `.rar`). Delete removes the mod (rar +
  its extracted folder), prompted. Active packs' names are written to
  `gamedata/texturemods/loadorder.txt`, highest first (a rar contributes
  `<rar>.extracted`).
- **RAR extraction** (`RarExtractor.cs`): the vendored unrar built as an x64
  `UnRAR.dll` is EMBEDDED in the launcher exe (`<EmbeddedResource>`), materialized
  to `%TEMP%\SilentHillPC_Launcher\UnRAR.dll` and `LoadLibrary`'d on first use — so
  extraction never depends on the DLL sitting next to wherever the launcher runs
  (the failure mode of the earlier "ship it beside the exe" attempt: `IsAvailable`
  returned false → nothing extracted). The launcher is forced 64-bit
  (`<Prefer32Bit>false`) so the x64 DLL loads. P/Invoke of the standard UnRAR C
  API; struct layouts mirror unrar's `dll.hpp` (`#pragma pack(1)`); validated
  end-to-end (open + extract a real nested `.rar`). Rars auto-extract on manager
  open / drop under the progress dialog (`ModManager.Prepare` /
  `PendingRars`).
- **Load / FMV mods** live in `mods/`: load-folder mods (a `load/` or
  disc-structured tree) → merged into `gamedata/load/` (forces
  `allow_loose_files=1`); FMV mods (`.avi`) → flattened into `gamedata/FMV/`.
  Deployed via a `mods/deployed.txt` manifest (deploy = copy, undeploy = delete
  tracked files); higher priority copied last so it overwrites. A `.zip` dropped
  as a load/FMV mod auto-extracts into the library once.
- Drag-and-drop onto the window auto-detects type and routes it (texture →
  `texturemods/`, load/FMV → `mods/`). Right-click a mod for a friendly display
  name + notes (stored in `mods/modmanager.json`, DataContract JSON; the folder /
  `.zip` name stays the identity). The Form1 button swaps to `manager_clicked.png`
  while pressed. Logic in `ModManager.cs`, UI in `ModManagerForm.cs`,
  progress in `ProgressDialog.cs`.

## PAL (SLES-01514) fonts + languages + FMV batch (2026-07-08, commits `52582ca4b`..`f97055547`)

- **Region-aware FONT16** (`f5dff3a48`): PAL's 21x6 glyph grid lives at VRAM
  (768,128) tpage 12, CLUT (816,255) — all values from the decrypted EUR
  BODYPROG (`pc_port/tools/decrypt_eur_overlay.py`, `33b74e812`; the disc
  "scrambling" is the game's own `Fs_DecryptOverlay` LCG). New
  `pc_port/src/font_region.c` layout table + `Font_MapChar()` accent scheme
  (retail-exact: Latin-1 at byte-0x8B, combining marks 114/119 for
  uppercase); text_draw.c's three draw sites compute UV/tpage/clut from
  `g_FontLayout` — USA output bit-identical (originals under `#else`).
  Co-tenant patches: BG_ETC reslice (IMAGE_ETC desc u=32,v=64 on EUR),
  FLAME → tpage 13 (832,0), particle dust/ember UV remap + rain v-clamp.
  FONT16 requeued at `GameFs_TitleGfxLoad` + per map load (Konami logo/
  BG_ETC stomp the font home during boot; retail SLES reloads it too).
- **Languages de/fr/es/it** (`f97055547`): config `language` redirects the 45
  VIN map overlays (name char 6 digit → VIN2-5) and 15 TIPS_E TIMs (letter
  char 5 → G/R/S/T) inside `Fs_InitFileTableForRegion`;
  `pc_port/src/lang_text.c` parses `ITEM_<lang>.BIN` (195 pairs, base
  0x800C8B68) through the s_ItemName/s_ItemDesc chokepoints and extracts +
  translates each map's message table from the loaded overlay (PAL `{X}`
  dialect → US `~X`, EUR link base 0x800CB370, universal index-3 join + 7
  probe-verified page-split joins). Also fixes a live PAL bug: the map-anim
  header patch in player_control.c now rebases EUR-linked overlay pointers
  (-0x1DF8).
- **FMV on PAL** (`270574235`): fmv_player opens the resolved disc
  (`PcPort_GetGameDiscPath`) and takes base sectors from the region-remapped
  `g_FileTable` (new `PcPort_FileTableStartSector`); all 30 movies verified
  byte-identical across discs (+0x1E88 sector shift only).
- **Launcher** (`52582ca4b`): any `gamedata/*.bin`, ISO-serial region probe
  (`DiscProbe.cs`), disc label in UI, Language dropdown; game-side
  `g_PcConfig.language`. Full status/reference:
  `pc_port/docs/PAL_Language_Support_Task.md`.

## Ambient SFX batch — severed-alias class + silent positions (2026-07-09)

23-map multi-agent audit of missing rain/water ambience (spec + full findings:
`pc_port/docs/Ambient_SFX_Task.md`). Discovered a NEW bug class beyond
zero-stubs: **severed PSX aliases** — two symbol names that shared one address
on PSX (sym tables show them 2–4 bytes apart, one inside the other's extent)
became separate PC objects, so writes through one name never reach reads
through the other. Invisible to zero-stub audits because both halves hold
"real" data.

- **Rain sound restored** (`bbcae1642`): `sharedData_800DD58C_0_s00` IS
  `g_ParticlesAddedCount[1]` on PSX; split on PC, so the rain-particle count
  never reached `Particle_SoundUpdate`'s ramp and `SD_Call(Sfx_Unk1360)` was
  unreachable — rain visuals, no rain sound, on map0_s00 / map1_s02 (otherworld
  school courtyard) / map1_s03 (roof) / map4_s02. Fixed with an SH_PC_PORT
  macro alias in `particle.c`. Same commit: map5_s03 defined
  `g_ParticlesAddedCount` as a scalar while `particle.c` zeroes `[1]` — real
  4-byte OOB write, now `s32[2]`.
- **map6_s04/s05 water fade** (`eb9d3f484`): `sharedData_800EB74A_6_s04` is
  byte `[2]` of the `sharedData_800EB748_6_s04` limits table on PSX; split on
  PC, so the fountain-room water layer played at constant full volume (frozen
  0x80 cap). SH_PC_PORT write-through into the table.
- **Courtyard ghost rooms / interior exact-cell draw** (`3b96cdc03`,
  2026-07-10): retail interior maps are isolated room islands (one per 40u
  cell, 16-28u dead gaps, zero cross-cell geometry; verified against US-disc
  IPDs) and retail drew ONLY the player's exact cell. The PC ±2/±1 interior
  window + 4-nearest pcInDrawSet drew neighbor islands floating over open
  areas (otherworld courtyard SUFFFE showed SU00FE/SUFFFF mesh-ceiling
  corridors). Interiors now draw exact-cell; removes pcInDrawSet and
  MapRegistry_IsExactCellArena. Widescreen needs no window: everything
  visible from a room lives in that room's chunk.
- **whole_map_exteriors draw path** (`286157766`, 2026-07-10): the flag only
  textured chunks; the visible square was set by per-poly far culls
  (min(fog.farDistance, ~61u OT cap)), baked subcell PVS (viewer ≤ ±3.2
  cells), and s16 view-Z wrap at 128u — fogstr never affected geometry. In
  whole-map mode the caps lift, wrapped depths bucket into the last OT slot,
  and previously fog-bounded OT inserts gain SH_CLAMP_OT_DEPTH.
- **Rain-path div-by-zero crash** (`800ac4ab1`, follow-up 2026-07-09): the
  restored rain path crashed 0xC0000094 one frame after `Sd_PlaySfx(1360)` —
  `Sfx_WithFalloffAndPitchPlay`'s `AttenuationCalc` divides by `falloff`, and
  the rain call in `particle.c` is the game's only `falloff=Q12(0.0f)` site.
  MIPS div-by-zero doesn't trap (quotient -1, which retail relied on); the
  guard returns -1 so rain volume matches PSX. Confirmed via objdump:
  exe+0xECA5A = the `idivl` in `AttenuationCalc`. Lesson: newly-reachable
  retail code was never covered by the Jun-11 div-zero sweep — re-audit
  divisions whenever a dead path is resurrected.
- **Elevator chime + pickup poses** (`b2e4adecf`): hospital elevator arrival
  ding (`sharedData_800CB094_3_s01`) silent on map3_s01/s03/s04/s05 — the exe
  stub hardcodes map7_s01's position ~170+ units away (attenuates to exactly
  0); per-overlay VECTOR3s appended. Plus map3_s01 elevator-stop clunk pos,
  map1_s03 valve-grip SVECTOR, and six map5_s00 sewer pickup poses (items at
  world origin).
- **Negative results that matter**: map5_s00 (main sewers) water data verified
  byte-exact — remaining silence reports need runtime `[SH_BGM]` probes, not
  data. map2_s01 is the CHURCH, not "Old SH sewers" (spec corrected); its
  pre-Dahlia silence is authentic. Shared Sd_* chain verified healthy
  end-to-end. Still open: map3_s05 vine-fire loop constant volume
  (`D_800DD190` = `sharedData_800D8568_1_s05+0x10`, another severed alias).

## NTSC-J (SLPM-86192 Rev 1/2) support (2026-07-10, commits `4af7db1c7` + `1ac340612`)

Full reference: `pc_port/docs/NTSC_J_Support.md`.

- **Region plumbing** (`4af7db1c7`): `Region_JPN` + SLPM/SLPS/SIPS serial
  probe (with first-print exe-t_size guard); `s_FileTable_JAP` from the
  in-tree JAP1 table — verified index-aligned with USA (2074 entries), so it
  memcpys straight in; JAP XA bases (US+5); audio sector remap generalized to
  every non-USA region; JAP overlay pointer rebase (link base `0x800CBBD0`,
  disc-verified); per-region disc buckets with auto priority USA>PAL>NTSC-J;
  `region = jap`; launcher NTSC-J playable (2026.7.10.1). TIM sweep ground
  truth: 996/996 shapes identical to US, only TIPS_E*/MEMO_INR differ in
  content (Japanese images, same names — zero code).
- **Japanese story text** (`1ac340612`): JP overlays carry SJIS messages with
  the SAME `~` code grammar as US → verbatim extraction at the JAP base;
  explicit US→JAP index tables for the 14 maps the US localization
  split/added lines in (`lang_jpn_msgmap.inc`, DP skeleton alignment);
  embedded public-domain Shinonome JIS X 0208 font replaces the BIOS kanji
  ROM (`pc_kanji.c`, `kanji_font.inc`, `tools/make_kanji_font.py`); on-demand
  12×16 4bpp atlas cells in the framebuffer margin strips (rows 16..31 /
  480..495 — retail JP's own band); SJIS branches in both string drawers +
  width calc. Latent EUR fix: `MSG_COUNT_MAX` 96→176 (MAP7_S02 has 159
  messages; the replaced pointer array under-covered 3 maps on PAL).
- **NTSC-J title + school Mumblers + 2D right-edge line** (`38bc60ea8`,
  `9c90980d3`): JP title = load TIM/TITLE.TIM at the GameFs_TitleGfx
  chokepoint (retail JP title code is instruction-identical to US — verified
  by decrypted-overlay structural diff); JP school maps (map1_s00..s03 +
  map6_s04) swap Grey Child->Mumbler models per map load (disc-verified
  spawn-group bytes); Screen_BackgroundImgDraw tiles clamped to the image's
  content extent — the PC-only -1 shift (f6354a417) dragged one foreign VRAM
  texel into the last visible column = full-height tinted line on 2D screens
  in all regions. Also flashlight mode labels shortened + page-2 value column
  204 so they fit the 320px clip.
- **PAL black item previews FIXED** (`534b12d6b`): the PAL discs' item packs
  (IT_00x/UNQxx TMDs) are NOT byte-identical to US — every textured prim's
  clut word is baked for the EUR retail palette homes (896..944, 480..495;
  retail moved them because PAL's 256-line framebuffers cover the US homes).
  Our port uploaded item palettes at the US homes, so PAL prims sampled empty
  palettes → black previews (center "discolored" via the carousel dim). Fix:
  Font_ApplyRegionPatches retargets the five item texture descs to the EUR
  homes (byte-verified against the decrypted EUR BODYPROG desc cluster). All
  item diagnostic probes removed. Lesson recorded: re-verify inherited
  "byte-identical" claims by hash — a wrong one steered this hunt for days.

## Mouse cursor — puzzles + clickable main menu (2026-07-13, commit `153fc7fc8`)

QoL feature, not a fix (config `mouse_cursor`, default on; inert while the
TPS/OTS/FPS camera captures the pointer). Game-code touch points:

- **`Gfx_CursorDraw`** (`bodyprog_800881B8.c`): SH_PC_PORT hook — the shared
  chokepoint every free-cursor puzzle (piano, plate, door panels, map pan)
  draws through. Hands `pc_mouse_cursor.c` the puzzle's current cursor position
  (framebuffer centre-origin px) and left/right click into enter/cancel on
  `g_Controller0`, so all puzzles gain mouse control with no per-puzzle code.
  Cursor control is an **absolute servo** (commit `18a49bc42`): the injector
  deflects the left stick proportional to the error between the puzzle's own
  cursor and the framebuffer point the mouse is over. The earlier delta-velocity
  injection lost range to the stick's ±127 clamp and the height scaling — at
  sensitivity 1 a full mouse sweep only covered ~62% of the puzzle's cursor
  range (e.g. piano X∈[-89,85]/Y∈[-71,84]px, moved by `leftX*16384/75`), so the
  cursor stopped ~2/3 down. The servo is closed-loop on the puzzle's own cursor,
  so it converges on exactly where the mouse points regardless of framebuffer
  height, stick scale, or the clamp; it engages on a mouse move and releases on
  arrival so an idle mouse leaves a real pad's stick alone.
- **`GameState_MainMenu_Update`** (`events/title.c`): hover selects / click
  confirms on the entry list and difficulty rows (hit-tests the authored row
  bands: y=184+i*20 and y=204+i*20); draws the pointer after the text. The
  pointer sprite is the game's own 32x32 arrow from BG_ETC.TIM (UV(0,64),
  CLUT (192,0), tpage 12) — resident at the menu in every region/boot path.
- **`MainLoop`** (`sys/game_main.c`): per-frame `Pc_MouseCursor_FrameUpdate`
  after the controller is built, before the state update reads it.

Window→viewport mapping comes from PsyCross `PsyX_MapWindowToViewport`
(submodule commit `63334e0`).

Extended to every menu screen in `87fdb4fad` (options main/extra/PC pages,
brightness, controller config, load/save incl. the Yes/No prompt): each
screen hit-tests its own authored row layout and injects the controller
bits its stock input code reads, so step/clamp/SFX/state logic is
untouched. Two invariants to preserve: (1) the controller-config Actions
pane must NEVER receive injected button bits — `ConfigUpdate` binds any
clicked button to the hovered action; (2) hover-select snaps
(`Prev = Selected`, no highlight-timer reset) so the click that follows
isn't swallowed by the `LINE_CURSOR_TIMER_MAX` input gate.

## Global chara/asset pool — spawn any monster in any map (2026-07-13, commits `b34fd5702`, `512762429`, `bfc5ad965`, review fixes `c0fd6785c`)

Config `global_chara_pool` (default 1); design doc `docs/Global_Chara_Pool.md`.
Vanilla loads only ~3 monster types per map (charaGroupIds); the pool keeps
EVERY chara's ILM/ANM resident PC-side (malloc'd, loaded once via the vanilla
FS queue at map-load case 6), gives each a dedicated anim slot (4+charaId in
the PC-grown `g_CharaModelAnimsData`) through the explicit-buffer
`Fs_CharaAnimDataAlloc` path map7_s03's boss rush already used, and routes
textures to persistent virtual GL slots 256+charaId (synthetic clutY>=512
desc; no VRAM bytes; CLUT rows >=16 spill to slot+64k for the 48-row PRS TIM).
`chara_global.dll` — a pseudo-map compiling every portable monster's AI with
no map define — backfills NULL `charaUpdateFuncs` slots per map load.
Native maps always win every registry (NULL/stale-only refresh), so native
gameplay is untouched; `global_chara_pool=0` is byte-identical to before.

- **Files**: `pc_port/src/pc_chara_pool.c(+h)`, `src/maps/chara_global/*`,
  hooks in `game_load.c` case 6 + `map_registry.c` + `main_pc.c`,
  hires_override slot-space growth (256→512, chara range persists reset).
- **Guards landed with it**: `Chara_SpawnFlagsSet/PositionSet` skip rows >1
  (pool idxs + latent vanilla slot-3 OOB into cameraPaths); console spawns
  are flagged (`g_PcNpcDebugSpawned`) so killing one no longer corrupts the
  savegame's native spawn-row alive-bits (`Savegame_EnemyStateUpdate` guard).
- **Excluded from AI backfill (map-bound)**: Twinfeeler, Incubus, Unknown23,
  LockerDeadBody, Chicken (no AI on disc), cutscene actors — they spawn as
  posed statues, tagged `[no-ai]`/`[pool]` in `SPAWN LIST`.
- **Known limitation**: foreign monsters play wrong/silent SFX (per-map
  ambient VAB program collisions); fix = extra PC VAB slot, deferred.

## Fan-translation support — disc-authoritative text on modified discs (2026-07-13, commits `db055e972` + `eaf93dce7`)

Fan patches (probe-verified against the Spanish fandub, USA + PAL variants)
edit the retail discs **in place** — ISO layout unchanged, file-table sectors
stay valid. The XA voice dub (~49k sectors in HILL.), repainted FONT16 accent
glyphs, TIMs (TIPS, map screens, memcard prompts, UFO) and VABs all stream
from the disc already; **text was the only thing the port compiles in**.

- **Disc selection**: config `disc_image` (exact filename in `gamedata/`)
  beats the region auto-pick — how a `-patched.bin` gets chosen next to the
  vanilla image. Launcher Disc dropdown writes it; `DiscProbe` flags
  `[modified]` when BODYPROG's first sector hash differs from retail (the
  overlay is LCG-XOR'd, so any in-place edit scrambles that sector).
- **Disc-authoritative USA text** (`lang_text.c`): on USA discs,
  `FanTextInit` reads + `Fs_DecryptOverlay`s BODYPROG off the disc and
  adopts its kerning table (0x80025D6C; the fandub repaints the glyphs for
  bytes `; < = > W X ' -` into full-width `á é í ó ú ñ ¿ ¡`) and its `INVENTORY_ITEM_NAMES` /
  `g_ItemDescriptions` pointer arrays (0x800ADB60/0x800ADE6C) when they
  differ from the compiled originals; `Pc_LangPatchMapMessages` grew a USA
  branch (link base 0x800C9578, identity indices, verbatim copies — fan text
  is already US markup dialect, pure ASCII). A **matching decompile means
  compiled text == vanilla disc text**, so vanilla discs compare equal and
  are a guaranteed no-op; per-map self-detection, no config gate. After the
  adversarial review, the USA branch reads the overlay itself off the disc
  image (`ReadDiscFile`) instead of consuming `g_OvlDynamic` — no
  `Fs_QueueWaitForEmpty` on USA (vanilla load timing untouched, no
  stale-buffer risk from the queue-drain timeout valve), NUL-validated
  string walk, malloc checks + pool caps, and the modified-vs-vanilla
  compare bounded to the 15 shared `map_msg_common.h` entries every
  compiled table starts with (the compiled arrays carry no count, so
  deeper indexing could run past a shorter table).
- **Menus**: the port renders menus from compiled strings a disc patch can't
  reach — `language = es` (etc.) now unlocks the existing `lang_menu.c`
  translations on fan-USA discs, and the title-options Language row shows
  there too.
- **PAL fandub needs zero engine changes**: it only edits the Spanish assets
  (VIN4 overlays, ITEM_SPN.BIN, TIPS_S) with identical structure/encoding —
  the whole thing rides the existing `language = es` pipeline.

## Randomizer gamemode (2026-07-14)

Config `randomizer` (default 0); design doc `docs/Randomizer_Mode.md`. New Game
always opens in map2_s04; every door is rerolled into locked / another area /
another room in this map / a miniboss / (1%) the final boss; each area gets 1-5
pooled monsters and rerolled item pickups; after 10 areas the run ends at the
map7_s03 boss with a score-picked ending. `randomizer = 0` changes nothing.

Rests on three facts about the engine, all verified against the map data:

1. **A door is just an `s_EventData` row** (`sysState` = LoadOverlay/LoadRoom).
   Randomizing doors = rewriting rows. On a LoadRoom row the `mapIdx` field is a
   **BGM track**, not a map.
2. **A door's arrival mapPoint lives in the SOURCE map but holds DESTINATION-space
   coordinates** (`D_800BCDB0 = mapPoints[eventParam]` is read *before*
   `GameBoot_MapLoad`). So a teleport into map X must reuse a record that some
   other map authored for its real door into X — `tools/gen_rando_data.py` harvests
   them (`RANDO_ARRIVALS`). No hand-placed coordinates anywhere.
3. **A locked door is a SECOND row on the same doorway** selecting the shared
   `MapEvent_DoorLocked`/`DoorJammed` — which exist at `mapEventFuncs[0]/[1]` in
   only **25 of 43 maps** (`RANDO_DOORFN_MASK`). Hence the mode appends its own
   handler so locking works uniformly.

- **Files**: `pc_port/src/pc_rando.c`, `include/pc_rando.h`,
  generated `include/pc_rando_data.h`, `tools/gen_rando_data.py`.
- **No map-DLL data is ever written**: the mode installs its own copy of
  `s_MapOverlayHdr` (the same swap `lang_text.c` uses) and rewrites the event /
  event-func / message / spawn tables inside the copy. It runs at the **tail of
  `GameBoot_MapLoad`, after the language patch**, and copies from whatever header
  is live — so it inherits translations instead of clobbering them.
- **Gotchas paid for during implementation**:
  - `TriggerType_None` is **never a door**. The miniboss post-death exits are
    `TriggerType_None` + LoadOverlay rows; treating one as a door strips its
    `requiredEventFlag` and teleports the player out of the arena on arrival.
  - map1_s05 / map4_s05 have exactly **one** spawn row and it **is** the boss —
    clearing native spawns there deletes the boss.
  - Monster placement must wait for the first gameplay frame (collision data), but
    `GameBoot_InGameInit` spawns before then, so native rows are cleared at load.
  - `ovlEnemyStates[mapIdx]` + `field_228C` persist across visits; both must be
    reset or a re-entered area is empty. Pickup event flags likewise retire a
    trigger for good — the mode learns which flags are pickups (any flag
    `Event_ItemTake` is called with) and clears them on re-entry.
  - The one degenerate arrival record in the game (map4_s05 -> map2_s02 is a (0,0)
    placeholder; vanilla repositions via the death cutscene) is filtered by the
    generator — teleporting to it drops Harry at the world origin.

## PGXP reached everything except the item models (2026-07-14, commit `6a9cb2c05` + PsyCross `638dc9e`)

**Symptom**: `use_pgxp` had no effect on the inventory carousel or the world item
pickup. Those models rendered affine (wobbling/swimming textures) whether PGXP was
on or off, while the rest of the scene responded to the setting normally.

**Root cause — a broken link in the shadow-propagation chain, not a disable.** PGXP
is address-keyed (`PsyX_GPU.cpp`): a vertex is precise only if a shadow entry exists
at the *prim field address* the GPU reads. Coverage is built by propagation along the
data path:

```
GTE store (gte_stsxy*)      -> Shadow_Store(destAddr, ...)
drawer copy (poly->xN = ..) -> Shadow_Copy(&poly->xN, &src)
GPU draw   (MakeVertex)     -> GetPreciseVertex(primFieldAddr, ...)
```

Both of the first two hops were missing on the item path:

1. The item models are the **only** users of `GsSortObject4J`
   (`item_screens_cam.c`), whose TMD drawers (`GsTMDfast*` in
   `pc_port/src/stubs/libgs_stub.c`) project via the PsyCross wrappers
   `RotTransPers`/`RotTransPers3`/`RotTransPers4`. Those wrappers use PsyCross's own
   `gte_stsxy*` macros (`psx/inline_c.h`), which — unlike the game's `gte_stsxy3c`
   in `pc_port/include` — **never call `PGXP_StoreAddr`**. Nothing was recorded.
2. The drawers then copy each projected word from a **stack temporary** into the prim
   field with a plain C store, so even a recorded shadow would not have followed the
   copy.

Result: `GetPreciseVertex` missed at every item vertex, returned `ppw = 0`, and the
vertex cleanly degraded to affine. Structurally off, regardless of the setting.

**Fix** (both halves gated on `g_PsxUsePgxp`; off = byte-identical):

- PsyCross `src/psx/libgte.c`: `RotTransPers`/`3`/`4` now `PGXP_StoreAddr` the
  addresses they write. `slot` = position in the 3-deep SXY FIFO at store time
  (2 = newest). The quad path captures v0..v2 **before** its follow-up RTPS, which
  otherwise shifts v0 out of the FIFO beyond recovery.
- `pc_port/src/stubs/libgs_stub.c`: new `TMD_PGXP3`/`TMD_PGXP4` macros call
  `Shadow_Copy` after each prim-field write — the item-path twin of `SH_PGXP_PROP3/4`
  in `bodyprog_80055028.c`. Applied at all 17 emit sites (9 triangle, 8 quad).

**Preserved**: the see-through fix is independent and untouched — `ITEM_PRECISE_SZ`
still feeds true per-vertex SZ via `PsyX_SetNextPrimSzExact`, and the
`PsyX_ForceItemDepthBegin/End` bracket in `game_main.c` still forces per-pixel depth
around the item-only OT0 draw.

**Side effect, deliberate**: `water.c` passes its prim fields *directly* as the
`RotTransPers4` output addresses, so water quads now also become PGXP-tracked when
PGXP is on (previously affine). This is the intended behaviour of the setting, but it
is a visible change to water with `use_pgxp = 1` and is worth an A/B.

## Alt cameras stand down for scripted scenes; optional TPS/OTS camera collision (2026-07-14, commit `ff77c3d85`)

**Symptom**: small in-engine scenes — Harry's sewer ladder descent above all — were
played from the follow/eye camera instead of the scripted shot, which ruined them.
The FPS camera in particular should only be live during actual gameplay.

**Root cause**: `Pc_TpsCamera_Apply` (the one function that applies TPS/OTS/FPS) only
bailed on the two LETTERBOX markers, `SysFlag_CutsceneActive` and
`cutsceneBorderState`. The small scenes raise neither — `map5_s00.c:685` is a plain
`Player_ControlFreeze()` + `Event_CameraPositionSet()` under `SysState_EventCallback`
and touches neither symbol. So the alt camera happily overrode the scripted camera.

**The guard, and why it looks the way it does.** `Pc_ScriptOwnsScene()` = a letterboxed
cinematic, OR the script driving **both** the camera and Harry. Two adversarial review
rounds killed the obvious single-term versions, each with a concrete break:

| Candidate term | What it breaks |
|---|---|
| `VC_USER_CAM_F` / `VC_USER_WATCH_F` alone | **No alt camera for the entire final boss fight.** `map7_s03`'s `Map_WorldObjectsUpdate → func_800E14DC` re-raises these *every frame* of the Incubus fight while the player has full control. Same class: `map6_s04` (Cybil), `map6_s02` (ladder), `map1_s03` / `map2_s01` region cams. The flags mean "somebody called `vcUserCamTarget` this frame" — not "a scene is playing". |
| `g_Player_DisableControl` alone | **Camera pops to classic on every memo and every item pickup.** `Event_ItemTake` freezes at `EventState_Initialize`, several frames *before* `Gfx_PickupItemAnimate` sets `BgmStatusFlag_Pause`, so the world block still runs in that window. `SysState_ReadMessage_Update` freezes every frame and never sets Pause. The flag means "the engine is driving Harry", which ordinary interactions do too. |

Together they are true exactly for the scripted scenes. `SysState_ReadMessage` is
excluded outright — examining a memo is never a scene (`control_style.c` already makes
the same carve-out). Note that standing down does **not** freeze the view:
`vcMoveAndSetCamera` has already placed the game's own camera that frame, so skipping
our override simply lets it through.

**Bonus fix**: the `fps_fov` block used to sit *after* the early-return inside
`Pc_TpsCamera_Apply`, so a stand-down skipped the restore and left the FPS FOV clamped
onto the scripted shot for the whole scene. It is now `Pc_FpsFov_Update()`, called on
both exits.

### `tps_camera_collision` (default 1)

Launcher Controls checkbox ("Allow thirdperson camera collision") + in-game Controls
options row + config key. Off = the TPS/OTS **render** eye keeps its full orbit
distance and is allowed to pass through geometry.

**The trap**: `g_TpsCamPos` is not just the render eye — it is the **free-aim ray
origin** (`player_control.c` `Ray_CharaTraceQuery`, and `Pc_AimAssistFind`'s cone
apex). The level trace is **double-sided** (`ray.c`: the surface test is a pure
straddle test, and the `gte_nclip` backface reject only runs for `useCylinder`), so an
origin sitting behind a wall hits that wall *first* and flips the shot ~180° back into
it — Harry would fire backwards whenever he backed into a corner.

So the pull-in still runs with collision off, and the aim origin is slid **along the
view line** by the pull distance. It is *not* set to the pulled-in point: that point
lies on `pivot → eye`, which is ~11° off the view axis (`tpLookAt.vy` is anchored to
Harry's chest, not the eye) and is measured from an un-shifted pivot, so it also
cancels part of the OTS shoulder offset. A ray from there is *parallel* to the line
the reticle draws — a constant miss at every range. Projecting the displacement onto
`g_TpsCamFwd` keeps origin and reticle collinear.

With collision on, the slide is skipped and the default path is byte-identical.

## Thirdperson FOV + aim-zoom sliders, OTS aiming in TPS (2026-07-14, commits `29f0633c8` + `5169c9ea6`)

Three launcher options (Controls dialog) with matching console commands. The in-game
rows landed a commit later on a new 4th options page — see the section after this one.

### `tps_fov` — default **71.1**, and why it is not 67.4

Thirdperson/OTS field of view, mirroring `fps_fov`. `Pc_FpsFov_Update` became
`Pc_CameraFov_Update` and now serves both cameras; Classic always keeps the game's
own projection.

**The default is load-bearing.** The GTE projection distance the game uses in
gameplay is `vcWork.geom_screen_dist`, which `vcExecCamera` writes via
`SetGeomScreen` every frame and which equals `g_GameWork.gsScreenHeight`. Gameplay
runs **progressive** (`Screen_Init(SCREEN_WIDTH, false)`), so that height is
`FRAMEBUFFER_HEIGHT_PROGRESSIVE` = **224**, not 240. On the 320-wide frame, H = 224
is a true horizontal FOV of `2*atan(160/224)` = **71.1°**.

`SetGeomScreen(h)` is only a genuine no-op when `h` equals the value the game already
set. 71.1° maps to `round(160/tan(35.55°))` = exactly **224**, so the default changes
nothing. Had this shipped with 67.4 (→ H = 240) every Thirdperson/OTS player's FOV
would have silently narrowed.

> **`fps_fov` had the same off-by-16 — fixed in `870d52a8f`.** Its shipped 67.4 default
> mapped to H = 240 while the game's real gameplay H is 224, so "default" first-person
> was slightly *narrower* than the game's true FOV, and its code comment claiming 67.4
> was "the game's native FOV / byte-identical" was simply wrong. Now 71.1 everywhere:
> the config default, `config.cfg`, the `FOV` console command (value + `default`
> keyword + its message), and the launcher (load, reset, `ClampFov`'s parse fallback,
> tooltip). 67.4/240 is the *interlaced* height — never propagate it to a new camera.

### `tps_aim_zoom_amount` — default 100 (0..200), replaces the on/off checkbox

Scales the aim dolly along a 0..200% range whose full-scale (200%) pulls **twice** as
far in as the old zoom: `TP_DIST_AIM_MAX = 2*TP_DIST_AIM - TP_DIST`, and `aimDist =
TP_DIST - ((TP_DIST - TP_DIST_AIM_MAX) * pct) / 200`. At **100% (the default)** it lands
on exactly `TP_DIST_AIM` (the original zoom — so existing configs saved at 100 are
unchanged), at 200% on `TP_DIST_AIM_MAX` (a new, deeper 2x pull), at 0% on exactly
`TP_DIST` (no zoom). The 0..200 scale was chosen over an earlier 0..100 (50=old) exactly
so a config already carrying `tps_aim_zoom_amount = 100` keeps its original feel instead
of jumping to the deepest zoom. The legacy `tps_aim_zoom` bool key is still parsed (→ 0
or 100) so an existing config migrates instead of reverting to the default; `ConfigManager`
appends new keys at EOF and the game parses last-assignment-wins, so the new key always
beats a lingering legacy line. Launcher slider + `ClampAimZoom` cap at 200.

### `tps_ots_aim` — default 1

Raising the gun in Thirdperson eases the camera into the Over-the-Shoulder framing
and back out when lowered; the shoulder-swap bind works there too. Implemented by
giving TPS a *resting* offset of 0 in the existing OTS block:

```c
restOff   = (style == Ots) ? OTS_OFFSET : 0;
targetOff = (isAiming ? OTS_OFFSET_AIM : restOff) * g_OtsSide;
```

The block is entered **every frame** in that mode — not only while aiming —
specifically so `s_otsOff` can ease *both* ways instead of snapping in from a frozen
value. With the option off, TPS never enters the block, so `s_otsOff` is neither
updated nor applied: byte-identical to before.

### Console

`TPSFOV <deg|default>`, `TPSAIMZOOM <0-100>`, `TPSOTSAIM [0|1]`, `CAMCOLLIDE [0|1]` —
all persist through `PcConfig_SaveKeyValue`.

### Why no in-game options rows

The PC options pages draw at `LINE_BASE_Y` 56 with `LINE_OFFSET_Y` 16 on a 240-line
screen, so a page holds ~11 rows. `PCOPT_C` (Controls) was already at capacity — the
`Camera_Collision` row added in the previous commit pushed `Back` to y = 248, off the
bottom edge, and has been reverted. Any further Controls rows need a 4th page.

## Cutscene timing overhaul — lossless clock + audio catch-up (2026-07-16, commit `983de8432`)

Root-cause batch for the widespread "subtitles at the wrong time / cutscene drifts
out of sync with the dialog" reports. A multi-agent audit of the timing stack
(core clock, DMS timeline, subtitles, XA voice, anim driver) produced 13
adversarially-verified findings; the fixes:

- **Lossless game clock.** The per-frame vCount pipeline lost real time at three
  truncation sites (`GsGetVcount` int cast → `GsClearVcount` epoch reset →
  `Q12_MULT` floor). The loss repeats every frame, so the whole game clock ran
  slow vs the wall-clock XA voices in proportion to fps: ~0.4% @60, ~3.3% @120,
  ~6.25% @240, ~27% uncapped (and stopped entirely above ~5.2kfps) — 6–11+
  seconds of scene/subtitle lag over a 3-minute cutscene. dt now derives from one
  cumulative Q12 clock (`GsGetCumulativeQ12`, fixed epoch); total error is
  bounded < 1/4096 s forever at any fps. Re-applies the *principle* of the
  reverted `edfe66887` — that revert's "map6_s04-only" premise is contradicted by
  the current reports, and it was evaluated under the since-fixed PAL-50Hz vblank
  bug with the genuinely-regressive cap-skip also active. Differences: single
  clock source, no carry statics, catch-up bounded by the PSX step (below).
  [`game_main.c`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/src/bodyprog/sys/game_main.c) ·
  [`libgs_stub.c`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/pc_port/src/stubs/libgs_stub.c)
- **Cutscene audio catch-up.** The 30fps cap + 15fps floor permanently discarded
  wall time on every slow frame (each load hitch pushed the scene further behind
  the still-playing voices; steady sub-30fps ran the whole scene in slow motion
  vs audio). During cutscenes the discarded time accrues to a bounded (2s) debt
  repaid by later fast frames — every frame's dt stays ≤ the PSX 30fps step
  (136 Q12), so DMS/anim stepping never sees a larger step than original
  hardware (the regression mode that killed the old cap-skip `18e35f202`).
  Also unifies `g_DeltaTimeRaw = g_DeltaTime` during cutscenes: subtitles /
  message timers / event waits ran on the raw clock, up to 2× the capped
  DMS/anim clock below 30fps; on PSX these were one variable.
- **ANIM-STUCK detectors on the anim clock.** The (A)/(B)/(C) bypass timers in
  `player.c` accumulated `g_DeltaTimeRaw` while the anims they watch advance on
  `g_DeltaTime` — below 30fps the detector ran up to 2× fast relative to the
  anim and could force-skip scene content. Now accumulate `g_DeltaTime`.
- **Dropped-voice subtitle release.** A page whose voice cmd is range-guarded
  away (table-overrun protection in `Event_DisplayMapMsgWithAudio`) waited out a
  1s fail-open before its text rendered. The drop now sets
  `g_PcMapMsgVoiceDropped` and the subtitle releases immediately; a `[MSGVOICE]`
  log marks each drop (diagnosis lead for the audioCmds-overrun class — six maps
  carry PC pad rows; a per-table length fix remains open).
- **map7_s03 boss motion dwell.** Projectile script nodes counted down once per
  *rendered* frame (8× fast at 240fps, 2× slow at the 15fps floor); dwell is now
  Q12 seconds consuming `g_DeltaTime` (`func_800D88E8`).
- **Good+ ending Aglaophotis bottle break on impact** (`func_800E514C`, commit
  `658b39399`). The thrown bottle hit the Incubator's head then hung intact ~0.7s
  before shattering. Its flight arc is case 27 (`g_Cutscene_Timer` 281→313); the
  scream (`SD_Call(Sfx_XaAudio606)`, case 30) fires at 313 = impact. The earlier
  fix keyed the shatter on `timer >= 320` (case 31's endTime = post-impact hold),
  guessing impact wrong. Shatter (`func_800D7144`) + hide the intact bottle now
  fire at case 30, so break/scream/reaction coincide. Lesson: a DMS projectile's
  impact anchor is the flight-arc end / impact-SFX beat, not the next
  `Event_CutsceneTimerAdvance` endTime.
- **fps_cap 31–59 honored.** Integer division (`60/fps`) silently turned those
  caps into 60fps; non-divisors of 60 now route through the SDL high-precision
  limiter.

Audit notes (verified non-bugs, do not re-investigate): DMS keyframe
interpolation is stateless (`dms.c` — a large step cannot smear across a camera
cut); `Anim_PlaybackOnce` clamps to `endKeyframeIdx` (equality waits are safe at
any fps); the typewriter's static glyph accumulator leak is ≤ 1 glyph; the MIN
double-eval of `GsGetVcount` loses no time (later sample is consumed).

## Trigger sweep + voice pacing follow-up (2026-07-16, commits `714f8caae`, `eeb1dadda`)

Completion of the timing overhaul's open items (map-wide multi-agent sweep, 61
findings adversarially verified; full voice-cmd table inventory):

- **PSX end-of-voice rhythm restored.** PSX ended a voice via the vblank
  watchdog at `audioLength+32` (~0.53s past the audio) — the authored
  inter-line pacing. OpenAL drain signaled instantly, so each line advanced
  ~0.5s early and long dialogs compressed. Drain now holds the finished signal
  until the watchdog moment; explicit stops still signal immediately.
  [`xa_player.c`](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/blob/pc-port/pc_port/src/xa_player.c)
- **XA freezes with the console** (`XaPlayer_SetPauseHold`), and the sector
  math derives from the parsed subheader (all 726 USA voice clips verified
  stereo 37800 by reading the disc — the old hardcode was benign on USA but
  wrong for other discs).
- **KeyOfWoodman pickup freeze root** (`player_control.c`): the PC `field_38`
  overlay re-patch sat inside the `mapAnimIdx`-changed guard; a (re)load with
  an unchanged anim idx left `field_38` on map0_s00's linked table whose
  missing rows made scripted poses no-ops (state 59's `0x12C` row exists only
  in the map's own overlay table — verified by parsing `MAP2_S00.BIN`). The
  patch now re-derives on every load.
- **Frame-counted cutscene pacing dt-scaled** (8x fast at 240fps): map2_s00
  cafe-exit/sketchbook map zooms + marking fades; map1_s06 boiler slide;
  map3_s03 plates-door cursor/slides; hospital elevator cursor (shared hdr);
  map5_s01 safe dial; GAME OVER + death-tip holds; map1_s03 locker swings.
- **Voice-table hardening**: the severed alias `Map_MessageWithAudio` got the
  range guard + dropped-voice release + `[MSGVOICE]` log; map6_s02's exe-stub
  voice index now resets at scene start (PSX zeroed it as overlay BSS). The
  table inventory confirmed every other table ends in authored zero tails or
  lives in per-load DLL data — no per-table lengths needed; the six pads stay.
- **Verified non-bugs** (do not re-fix): generic `AwaitAnimEnd`-style `==1`
  polls are safe on PC (range-form `Player_AnimPlaybackStateGet` +
  self-linking one-shot map anims); NPC one-shot waits have no relink race —
  the c4c8d5369 class was player-lower-body-driver specific.
- **Known-cosmetic remainders** (verified minor, not fixed): map6_s04 carousel
  ramp/FX grid decays, map6_s03 corpse bob, map4_s03 theater blink, map5_s00
  sewer-scare pacing, map7_s03 FX grids; plus unverified-minor map7 close-up
  fades. All are per-frame FX pacing with clamps (no freezes possible).

## Characters darker than PSX — double fog on character prims (2026-07-16, commit `c3ed32011`)

User report (cafe-intro side-by-side vs DuckStation): characters render darker
relative to the environment than PSX. Measured off the captures: character-only
deficit ≈ ×0.90 = worldTint/boostedColor, world geometry + subtitles at exact
parity (the "vertical squish" half of the report measured as no difference).

Root: character/lit-model prims were fogged **twice** on PC. The CPU flat-light
dispatch (`func_8005A21C` → `func_8005A42C/A478/A838`) fed the fog-attenuated
alpha into the GTE depth-cue (the PSX mechanism — fade toward the black far
color, with the map-gain boost via negative-IR0 extrapolation: tint 121 →
boosted 133 in the cafe), and the prim builder *also* attached per-vertex fog
bytes (`PC_SCREEN_Z_TO_FOG`) that the PsyCross shader blends toward the fog
color — the PC mechanism that replaced CPU vertex fog for the *world*
(`VTXCOL_LDDP(dp)` → `gte_lddp(0)`). The shader bytes were added while
characters still rendered unfogged (the old `isFogEnabled=0` wrap around
Harry's draw); when that wrap was root-fixed, the compensation became a
double-application — characters darkened by both fades in every foggy scene
while the world stayed correct.

Fix: the PC character light dispatch uses the no-fog alpha, keeping only the
`field_20` light boost in the dpcs; the shader owns all character fog with the
same curve as world geometry. Verified faithful along the way: PsyX GTE `lddp`
(signed IR0) and DPCS negative-IR0 extrapolation, `lm_reformat` byte-0xB
bitfields, character model routing (`fB0=1` → lit drawer). `[LIGHTCMP2]`
probe (world_draw.c) remains until user confirm, then strip.

## Puppet Nurse crash after the Stone of Time puzzle — stale field_124 (2026-07-16, commit `9ad4f5455`)

User report: crash after doing a puzzle in Nowhere (map7_s01). Access
violation reading `0x2c0` in `PuppetNurse_AnimUpdate` (inside map7_s01.dll,
which `#include`s puppet_nurse.c via characters.c), right after a native
Puppet Nurse spawns.

Trigger: the Stone of Time pickup sets `EventFlag_M7S01_PickupStoneOfTime`,
so map7_s01's npcSpawnEvent `func_800DEDA4` calls
`Chara_SpawnFlagsSet(16, 3, SpawnFlag_0|1|3|4)` = 27 → spawn slot 3 fires a
nurse with `stateStep = 27` → `charStatIdx = 3`, `modelVariantIdx = 3`.

Fault (from disassembling map7_s01.dll + the exe): line
`(&animInfoBase[status])->playbackFunc(...)` with
`animInfoBase = field_124->animInfo_24 == NULL`, `status = 22` →
`22 * sizeof(s_AnimInfo)=0x20 = 0x2c0`. `field_124` is a valid **non-NULL**
pointer whose `+0x28` reads 0 — a **stale** value in the recycled npc slot
that does not point at `sharedData_800D5710_3_s03` (whose `animInfo_24` is
always populated by `PuppetNurseData_Init`). The data plumbing is fine: the
map DLL correctly PE-imports the exe's live, initialized instance array
(hospital nurses use the identical import; verified `objdump -p`), and
`__fu12` auto-import references — not copies — the exe's `.bss`.

The existing PC guard forced `PuppetNurse_Init` only on
`controlState==0 || field_124==NULL`, so a stale non-NULL `field_124`
slipped through → Init skipped → the stale pointer's null `animInfo_24`
dereferenced. Fix: harden the guard (nurse + doctor) to also re-Init when
`field_124->animInfo_24 == NULL` (short-circuits after the NULL check).
Re-Init restores `field_124 = &sharedData[charStatIdx]` from the intact
`model.stateStep`, so the nurse animates correctly.

LESSON: a re-Init guard keyed only on `ptr == NULL` misses **stale non-NULL**
pointers in reused npc/object slots. When a "was this initialized?" guard
must survive slot recycling, test a field the initializer always populates
(here `animInfo_24`), not just the top-level pointer.

## map6_s04 Flauros cutscene desync — unpad the subtitle page-advance gate (2026-07-16, commit `d9a34e548`)

The Alessa/Harry/Flauros amusement-park cutscene (`func_800E3EF4`, AMUSE2.DMS;
Harry shoved back, "Damn!" = msg 48) drifts progressively out of sync —
dialogue and subtitles fall seconds behind the on-screen action, worst by
"Damn!". Root-caused by a multi-agent trace of build `60e049203` (includes all
prior timing fixes) + the user's `alesssa.log`; two adversarial verifiers
confirmed.

Root: the `714f8caae` end-of-voice pad (holds the XA "finished" signal ~490 ms
past real audio drain) leaks into the PC-only subtitle page-advance gate. A
voiced page auto-advances only when `mapMsgTimer==0 && !pcVoiceHold`, and
`pcVoiceHold = VoiceDialog && Sd_AudioStreamingCheck()==1`, which stays 1
through the pad. So each voiced page held `max(authored ~J timer, voiceLen +
490 ms)` instead of `max(authored, voiceLen)`. The scene's authored `~J` page
timers were tuned to slightly exceed the voice content (msg42 monologue:
authored 12.0 s vs voice 10.6 s), so the pad flips the winning term on
essentially every page → +~490 ms per voiced line accumulating across the
serialized dialogue track, while the DMS animation runs at true wall-clock
(`983de8432`, correct). On PSX this path had **no** voice gate at all
(`pcVoiceHold`/`D_800BCD74` are entirely `#ifdef SH_PC_PORT`); pages advanced
on the `~J` timer alone. Log proof: every voice `playedMs = expMs + ~490 ms`,
voices strictly serialized (no overlap — refutes the pile-up theory).

`983de8432` (lossless clock) is the **enabler not the regressor** — it made
the animation wall-clock-correct, unmasking the pad's lag; kept. Typewriter
(`377fff821`) benign. No reverted regression touched.

Fix (surgical): `Xa_IsVoiceAudioDraining()` (xa_player.c) — true only while the
voice is actually producing audio (mirrors `XaPlayer_Update`'s true-drain test
but excludes the `s_xaPadEndMs` tail). `pcVoiceHold` (map_msg_display.c) now
gates on that instead of the padded flag, so voiced pages advance at real
audio drain — authored `~J` pacing restored, dialogue re-aligned to the
animation. The pad + guard stay intact for their other consumers (the step-43
inter-DMS load barrier, BGM transitions, console-freeze pause, PAL/JP sector
math). `pcVoiceHold` still prevents PC's instant next-line SD_Call from cutting
a live voice (the PR#17 anti-overlap fix). Under `SH_PC_PORT`; 30fps PSX build
byte-identical. Helps every voiced cutscene.

LESSON: a global "voice finished" pad meant to replicate a PSX watchdog must
not feed a gate that another authored timer already covers — it double-counts.
Scope such pads to the ONE consumer that needs them.

## map6_s04 Flauros cutscene voice desync — resume-not-restart voice index (2026-07-17, commit `554559f69`)

Long-standing (since the port began): the amusement-park Flauros cutscene
(`func_800E3EF4`) is badly out of sync — "as soon as Flauros appears you hear
Alessa scream 5-10s before she should on screen, then the whole scene is out of
sync." Root-caused by a multi-agent trace + 2 adversarial verifiers against the
voice table and the log.

Root: a shared monotonic voice index over-runs by +1 — the `fea838462` map7_s00
class. `func_800E3EF4` displays msg47 at BOTH case7 and case9, sharing one index
(`D_800ED5AC`) into the 34-entry table `D_800EBA64`. Case7 runs the message
alongside a cutscene timer with `autoAdvance` (frames 24→39 = 1.5s); the step
advances to whichever finishes first. **PSX**: CD-load latency keeps the display
from completing before the timer hits 39, so case9 RESUMES it (`isMgsStringSet`
stays true) and fires no new voice. **PC**: the voice loads instantly, msg47
completes in ~1.1-1.4s (< 1.5s), so `isMgsStringSet` goes false and case9
RESTARTS fresh — the setup path returns `MapMsgState_Finish` and fires an EXTRA
`SD_Call` + index bump. The +1 shifts every later line to the next clip, so the
373ms scream/gasp (`D_800EBA64[6]`) fires at case9 (~7.8s before its case17
Flauros beat), then the whole scene is shifted. Log confirms: strict in-order
walk `537..554` then a lone `[MSGVOICE]` drop of `0x0000` at `audioIdx=34` = one
extra Finish (35 fired vs 34 authored).

Fix (shared, PSX-faithful): suppress the voice fire + index bump for a
setup-Finish that is a same-index RE-DISPLAY of the just-completed line
(`map_msg_display.c` flags it via `msgIdx == mapMsgIdx` in the setup branch;
`Event_DisplayMapMsgWithAudio` skips fire+increment when flagged). Reproduces
PSX's resume-not-restart single-fire, keeping the index in lockstep. The flag is
0 for page-advance Finishes (multi-page lines always fire) and genuine first
displays. `SH_PC_PORT`-only; 30fps PSX byte-identical. Generalizes to map7_s00
(its `fea838462` pad becomes redundant but harmless). The `d9a34e548` pcVoiceHold
unpad is KEPT — it targets the separate ~490ms inter-line pad accumulation and is
orthogonal.

LESSON: msg-index selects the SUBTITLE TEXT but a separate shared monotonic index
selects the VOICE CLIP; anything that changes the page-Finish COUNT (instant PC
voice load winning a message-vs-timer race, an extra typewriter break, a re-
display) walks the voice index off its lines. When PC timing flips a msg-vs-timer
race the game authored around CD latency, restore the PSX resolution, don't just
pad the table (padding only absorbs a tail drop, never a mid-scene shift).

## map7_s00 Lisa cutscene — no-op the spurious restart of a multi-page chain (2026-07-17, commit `8a5cfd53c`)

The Lisa death scene (`func_800D0B64`) reported: "halfway through, Harry says
'It's a temporary thing' twice, then the audio runs out before the subtitles."
Same case7/case9 re-display class as Flauros above, but the MULTI-PAGE variant.

The scene shows the `msg30->34` CHAIN (only msg34 carries `~E`; 30 "Harry help
me", 31 "so scared", 32 "It's only a temporary thing", 33 "shock", 34 "don't
fret") at BOTH case7 `DisplayMapMsg(30)` and case9 `DisplayMapMsg(30)`, sharing
`g_Cutscene_MapMsgAudioIdx` into the 23-entry `g_Cutscene_MapMsgAudioCmds` (idx
0-22, then a `0x0000` terminator + the `fea838462` pad). PSX: CD latency keeps
case7's chain mid-flight when the step advances, so case9 RESUMES it (no re-show,
no new voice). PC's instant load COMPLETES the whole chain at case7, so case9
RESTARTS it — every page's subtitle re-shows ("temporary thing" a second time)
and pages 2..N re-fire their voices, walking the audio index past idx 22 into the
`0x0000` pad, so the tail lines (msg35..37) fall silent.

`554559f69`'s voice-only suppression only covered the chain's FIRST re-display
page, so the continuation pages still leaked. FIX (`map_msg_display.c`, top of
`Gfx_MapMsg_Draw`): a re-display (`msgIdx == mapMsgIdx && !isMgsStringSet`) whose
just-completed display was MULTI-PAGE (`g_MapMsg_CurrentIdx != msgIdx`) returns
`MapMsgState_SelectEntry0` immediately — a full no-op that just advances the scene
step, matching the PSX resume (no subtitle re-show, no voice, no index bump).
Cutscene-gated (`SysFlag_CutsceneActive || cutsceneBorderState`) so ordinary
memo/item re-examination is untouched. `SH_PC_PORT`-only; 30fps PSX byte-identical.

DISCRIMINATOR: `g_MapMsg_CurrentIdx` (last displayed page) vs `msgIdx` (chain
start) differ only for a multi-page chain, so SINGLE-page re-displays (map6_s04
Flauros msg47, `CurrentIdx == msgIdx`) fall through to `554559f69`'s lighter
voice-only path and keep their proven step timing. That matters: Flauros's case9
has `autoAdvance=false`, so its message-completion duration gates when
`Chara_Load(Flauros)` fires — an instant no-op there would shift the Flauros model
~1.7s early. Lisa's case9 timing is decoupled (the DMS animation runs off
`g_Cutscene_Timer` every frame at the bottom of the scene function), so the no-op
is safe. LESSON: the case7/case9 resume idiom has two shapes — single-page
(voice-only suppress) and multi-page chain (no-op the whole restart); tell them
apart by `g_MapMsg_CurrentIdx` vs `msgIdx`.
